Join us for an exploration of the wide variety of options for running your .NET, .NET Core and PowerShell-based applications and serverless microservices on AWS. We will examine options for deploying and hosting code using AWS CodeDeploy and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and use of serverless and container technologies such as AWS Lambda and Amazon Elastic Container Service. To work with these services we will show how the tools for .NET development from AWS — AWS SDK for .NET/AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio/AWS Tools for PowerShell/AWS Lambda Tools for PowerShell/AWS Tools for Visual Studio Team Services (now Azure DevOps) — make it a snap to get your code up and running. This session is suitable for those with little to no experience of AWS, as well as those with some exposure to AWS services.
