If you work on a multi-tenant application, you understand the value of multi-tenant deployments and deploying different versions of your application to different customers at different times.

Even if your application doesn't support tenants, there are several reasons that you might consider multi-tenant deployments for your CI/CD pipeline. Maybe each team needs to deploy to an isolated development environment, you need to QA or UAT test different versions at the same time, or you deploy your application to various geographic regions.

If I've piqued your curiosity, join me in this session where we'll walk through multi-tenant deployment patterns and how they enable these scenarios for your team. We'll configure some example multi-tenant deployments in Octopus Deploy and show how your CI server can play a role in supporting the multi-tenant pipeline.

Concepts covered:

- Multi-tenant application types
- Multi-tenant deployment patterns
- Continuous Delivery / Deployment Automation Server (Octopus Deploy)
- Multi-tenant deployments in Octopus Deploy
- Continuous Integration / Build Automation Server (Appveyor/Azure Devops)

Ryan works with some of Octopus Deploy's largest customers to help them be successful in their continuous delivery efforts. He is also active in the broader Octopus community answering questions in Slack, recording videos for the Ask Octopus series, and visiting conferences and user groups to speak about CI/CD and Octopus Deploy.

Before joining the Customer Success team at Octopus, Ryan was a developer and happy Octopus Deploy user. He's always taken an interest in improving processes and automating tasks where possible. This naturally led him to CI/CD and a several phase project to improve his team's build and deploy pipeline. By the end, his team had a fully automated build and deploy process that integrated with our other tools through APIs. They even had recurring scheduled deployments to keep our test and demo environments up to date.

Outside of developing and advocating, Ryan performs comedy around Dallas, belongs to two needy cats, and likes to travel to new places and sampling their vegan food!
