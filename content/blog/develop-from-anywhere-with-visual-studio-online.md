Whether you’re working on a long-term project, a  short-lived feature branch, or want to quickly review a pull request, Visual Studio Online can help you be more productive by providing a fully configured development environment in minutes. Access your environment from VS Code or a browser based editor; you’re no longer tied to one machine to do your development tasks! I’ll go over a bit of VSO’s history and then spend most of our time on demos and questions to help you assess whether VSO is right for you!
