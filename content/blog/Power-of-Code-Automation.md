Whether you are building a small n-tier application for a mobile application or a Fortune 500 Enterprise class n-tier/SOA implementation with all of the bells and whistles, the basic services that sit between the layers of your application are both critical and at the same time kind of boring. Very few things will impact an application in terms of performance or security failures faster than a poorly implemented/performing service layer. Leveraging a code automation tool (such as CodeFactory), within Visual Studio 2019, we will demonstrate how to efficiently build customized service layers that will help to ensure that a Contract Driven-Architecture standards are met regardless of who is actually doing the coding. Applying code automation to solve architecture problems, pattern adherence and skill set gaps. Skill set gaps and how proper architecture solves them Leveraging patterns to address architecture and skill set challenges Using software factories to solve architecture and skill set problems
